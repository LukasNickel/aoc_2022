#+title: README


* Why though?
I would like to get better in emacs, but cant even understand the configs
I copied from all over the place. There is only one way out of this:
Learning ELISP.

* How does this work?
I will try to have one org file for each day and
put the solution in _src_ blocks.
That should make the solutions easy to understand.
Most likely it will work so great, that
I fail aoc after at most two weeks as usual.

* Utils
** Loading data
#+name load_data
#+begin_src elisp
(defun read-lines (filePath)
  "Return a list of lines of a file at filePath."
  (with-temp-buffer
    (insert-file-contents filePath)
    (split-string (buffer-string) "\n" t)))
#+end_src

** Download
Apparently this:

#+name download_puzzle
#+begin_src elisp :var day=3
(require 'url)
(url-copy-file (format "https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/%s/input" day) "input")
#+end_src

is not possible, because you need a session cookie as the puzzle input is personalised.
I could do that, but actually...
Lets just do it by hand.
