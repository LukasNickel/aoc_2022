* Why though?
I would like to get better in emacs, but cant even understand the configs
I copied from all over the place. There is only one way out of this:
Learning ELISP.

* How does this work?
I will try to have one org file for each day and
put the solution in _src_ blocks.
That should make the solutions easy to understand.
Most likely it will work so great, that
I fail aoc after at most two weeks as usual.

- [[file:puzzles/day1.org::Part 1][Day 1]]
- [[file:puzzles/day2.org::Part 2][Day 1]]
